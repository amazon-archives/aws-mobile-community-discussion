Sign-in to one of the providers you have set up and it should take you back to the main screen and the "Sign-In" button will change to "Sign-Out". Then, tap on the "User Sign-in" demonstration section of the App and tap on the "Demo User Identity" button at the bottom. You will see a unique identifier for the user as well as a name for the user. This unique identifier identifies the user to AWS systems and provides the user temporary permissions to access your configured AWS resources.

Click on the Cognito Identity Pool for your project and you will see that the "Total identities" value is now greater than zero. If you used Facebook or Google Login then you will see the number of authenticated users for that provider under the "Authentication methods" in the Cognito console.

This section simply provides information about the generated code in the MySampleApp project.<br/><br/>

The AWS Identity Manager keeps track of the identity of the current app user, by storing the user's Amazon Cognito Identity ID. In order to do this, the identity manager handles some of the App Delegate calls from the iOS platform, and it is partially responsible for signing the user in to the app, regardless of whether a third party identity provider, such as Facebook or Google, is in use.

This section simply provides information about the generated code in the MySampleApp project.<br/><br/>

The User File Manager uploads and downloads files from Amazon S3. It caches downloaded files locally on the device in a size-limited cache. Downloaded files may be pinned to the cache, so that they are not automatically removed when the cache size limit is exceeded. The User File Manager provides access to two folders in the Amazon S3 bucket, one called "public/" for public files, which are accessible to any user of the app, and one called "private/" which contains a sub-folder for each Amazon Cognito identified user that is signed-in to the app. Files in the user's private folder can only be accessed by that user. The User File Manager serves as the application's interface into the file-related functionality of the User Data Storage feature.

This section simply provides information about the generated code in the MySampleApp project.<br/><br/>

User Profile Data is part of the User Data Storage feature. It allows you to save key/value pairs in datasets for each user of your mobile app. This can be used to store things like game progress or user settings. For users who sign in to the app, those datasets will be synchronized across all of the user's devices. This functionality is provided by the Amazon Cognito Sync service, and the Amazon Cognito Sync client is the application's interface to that service. There is no additional bootstrapping required to get an instance of the Amazon Cognito Sync client beyond what is already done by the AWS Mobile Client.

Your generated Sample App contains a demonstration of using the DynamoDB Mapper to perform queries and scans against the NoSQL tables you configured in your Mobile Hub project. The following folder contains all the code for the NoSQL Demo. The *Table.swift files contain the example code to demonstrate insert, remove, query, and scan operations against your tables. The files named <YourTableName>.swift is the model class for your configured table. The DynamoDB object mapper uses these annotated model  classes to provide convenient marshaling between your Swift App and DynamoDB's JSON requests and responses.
